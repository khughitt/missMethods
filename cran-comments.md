## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added some details and references in the description.
* replaced \dontrun{} by \donttest{} in my Rd-file.

R-hub generated one new note, which occured on no other test environment:
  Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
    DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth499
   
I checked the DOI (on https://www.doi.org/). It is valid: 
https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bth499
